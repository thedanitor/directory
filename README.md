## Description

The app was created with the following user story in mind:

*As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.*

## Technologies Used

* Bootstrap: CSS framework
* React: JavaScript framework

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Usage

The user can search for an employee by name by typing into the search bar. 
The list will be dynamically filtered by name as the user types.
When the user hovers over the Name or Email headings a triangle will appear.
The lists can be sorted alphabetically or reverse-alphabetically by clicking on the triangle.
